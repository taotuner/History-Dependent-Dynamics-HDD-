HDD — History-Dependent Dynamics
A Methodological Framework for Disentangling History Dependence, Recurrence, Self-Reference, and Self-Modeling in Dynamical Systems
Author: Taotuner
DOI: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.21955745

Overview
HDD (History-Dependent Dynamics) is a falsifiable methodological framework for disentangling five inferential claims that are frequently conflated across disciplines:

Construct I — History-Dependent Predictive Structure

Construct II — Causally Demonstrated Trajectory Dependence

Construct III — Causally Identified Feedback Recurrence

Construct IV — Functional Self-Reference

Construct V — Self-Modeling

The core thesis:

Evidence that a system depends on its history should not automatically be interpreted as evidence for more specific forms of dynamical organization.

Each construct requires its own experimental evidence. None implies the next. None implies consciousness.

The framework has three domain-specific companions — HDD-ISA for artificial architectures, HDD-ESA for engineered dynamical systems, and HDD-BIO for biological systems — which translate the same inferential structure into the interfaces, estimands, and reporting requirements appropriate to each substrate.

2026g	HDD-BIO — Biological Reporting and Experimental Framework	10.5281/zenodo.22980267	Biological companion: reporting standards, estimands, and applicability-bounded CO protocol
Family structure. HDD is the root document. HDD-ISA, HDD-ESA, and HDD-BIO are its three domain-specific companions, each translating the same constructs into a different class of system. HDO supplements HDD-BIO specifically, as a philosophical companion to the biological case. The position of the HDD Ethical Framework in this tree is left as an open question.

Key Results
Construct I Benchmark (2026a)
System	HDD-I	Relative Improvement (τ=10)	95% CI	p-value
Markov	−	-0.012%	[-0.000006, 0.000003]	0.711
Hidden State	+	+9.60%	[0.002408, 0.002761]	< 0.001
Delay Line	+	+31.94%	[0.004557, 0.004932]	< 0.001
Recurrent	+	+6.75%	[0.001420, 0.001658]	< 0.001
Accuracy against ground truth: 100%

Robustness: 100% positive fraction across 5 random seeds for all non-Markov systems. Zero false positives for Markov.

Unified System (2026f)
All five constructs operating simultaneously in a single loop. 20 seeds, 600 steps per seed. Environment is a Rule 30 cellular automaton; substrate is F₁₃³.

Construct	Metric	Value	Classification
C-I (held-out)	Prediction reduction, held-out vs. placebo	+5.63% ± 3.58% vs. −20.03% ± 11.03%, p ≤ 0.0002	Supported
C-II	Twin divergence	13.0125 ± 0.3261 (max 18)	Supported
C-III	Twin divergence (narrow reading)	13.0125 ± 0.3261	Supported
C-IV	Blind identification accuracy	100% (20/20)	Supported
C-V	Gain from correct identification	+0.5857 ± 0.0941	Supported
Criterion applicability test. The HDD Ethical Framework's Criterion of Organizational Coherence (CO, §4.2) was tested against a computational system constructed to be in the class the framework itself designates as outside its scope. Result: an individuation metric constructed from HDO Thesis 4 does not track functional collapse, and in fact increases under full kill (0.4845 → 0.5503, p = 0.0022) even as viability and twin divergence drop to zero. This confirms the framework's own expectation in §4.5 and grounds the operationalization gap identified in §4.4.

HDD-BIO (2026g)
HDD-BIO is a proposed reporting and experimental framework, not a benchmark. It provides:

Concrete, prespecified estimands for C-I (§5.0) and C-II (§6.0).

A minimal statistical specification for C-I (§5.1).

Mandatory residual-latent sensitivity for C-II causal claims (§6.3).

Three-condition operationalizations of C-IV (IV-1 ∧ IV-2 ∧ IV-3) and C-V (V1 ∧ V2 ∧ V3 with a self-vs-world control).

An executable eight-step protocol for organizational coherence that separates organizational necessity from global damage (§10.1).

A worked retrospective mapping of the C-I/C-II checklist onto a published planarian study (§6.2), classifying the existing result as not demonstrated for C-I and underdetermined for C-II.

A dedicated validation section (§15) specifying what would count as validating the framework itself.

No new biological experiments are run in HDD-BIO; it is a candidate reporting discipline awaiting independent application.

Interpreting the Results
Classification Criteria (HDD-ISA §14)
Symbol	Meaning
Supported	The evidentiary bar was met
Negative Evidence	Tested under adequate conditions; bar not met
UE	Uninterpretable — insufficient evidence or internally inconsistent
NI	Non-identifiable — available interventions cannot separate competing hypotheses
What Positive Construct I Means
A positive Construct I classification means only that historical information improved out-of-sample prediction relative to the specified observed present state and current input.

It does NOT establish: a memory mechanism, recurrence, self-reference, self-modeling, agency, or consciousness.

The Hidden State Example
The Hidden State system is especially important: a positive result does not mean the system has explicit memory. History may simply reveal information about a latent variable. This illustrates the observation-model problem that HDD is designed to address.

What the Unified System Establishes
The unified system (2026f) demonstrates that all five constructs can be simultaneously instantiated within one system without detectable mutual interference. The result supports HDD's central methodological claim: the constructs are independently testable.

It does NOT establish:

That HDD as a framework is empirically validated across architectures

That C-III is demonstrated under the HDD-ISA §11 specification (only the narrow operational reading — action-contingent divergence)

That the Criterion of Organizational Coherence is wrong (only that one operationalization is inadequate, matching the framework's own §4.4 assessment)

Scope of Validation
What Has Been Demonstrated
✅ Construct I — History-Dependent Predictive Structure (standalone benchmark, 2026a; and held-out with placebo, 2026f)

✅ Construct II — Causal Trajectory Dependence (twin divergence, 2026f)

✅ Construct III — Feedback Recurrence (narrow reading: action-contingent divergence only; not the HDD-ISA §11 specification, 2026f)

✅ Construct IV — Functional Self-Reference (blind intervention, 2026c; extended to four-variable system, 2026f)

✅ Construct V — Self-Modeling (gain from correct identification, 2026f)

✅ Construct coexistence — All five in a single loop without interference (2026f)

✅ Criterion applicability — HDD Ethical Framework §4.5 empirically grounded (2026f)

What Has NOT Been Demonstrated
❌ HDD as a whole — Not validated across a diversity of architectures

❌ C-III under HDD-ISA §11 specification — Requires independently bypassable feedback pathway with capacity-matched control; current implementation uses only the narrow reading

❌ Scaling — State space is F₁₃³; extension to GF(169) or larger fields untested

❌ Robustness across environments — Only one environment tested (Rule 30 CA)

❌ Operationalization of CO — One natural operationalization tested and found inadequate; the criterion itself remains intact but not operationalized

❌ Biological validation of HDD-BIO — Retrospective mapping of one published study (§6.2); no independent application or inter-observer replication attempted

❌ Consciousness, sentience, agency, moral status — No claims made or supported

Relations Between Documents
Document	Relation to HDD
2026a (HDD)	Framework. Defines the five constructs and their evidential conditions.
2026b (HDD-ISA)	Interface specification. Translates constructs into architectural requirements. Not exercised in this repository's benchmarks.
2026b2 (HDD-ESA)	Engineering companion. Translates constructs into five causal-discrimination tests for physical control systems (motion, thermal, fluid, chemical, power), with design-for-testability rules and shared reporting categories.
2026c (C-IV)	Isolation test of Construct IV. Establishes the blind intervention mechanism.
2026d (HDO)	Ontological interpretation. Not a construct; provides the Individuation Criterion operationalized in 2026f's CO test. Supplements HDD-BIO.
2026e (Ethics)	Precautionary protocol. The Criterion of Organizational Coherence §4.2 is tested in 2026f; the result matches §4.5's expectation.
2026f (Unified)	Joint instantiation. Demonstrates coexistence and grounds the framework's own scope assessment.
2026g (HDD-BIO)	Biological companion. Translates the constructs into reporting standards, concrete estimands, and an applicability-bounded CO protocol for living systems. Ontologically agnostic: can be applied with or without the HDO interpretation.
